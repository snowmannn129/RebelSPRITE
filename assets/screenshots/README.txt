Screenshot Placeholder

This directory is intended to hold application screenshots for use in the manifest.json and documentation.

To create a proper screenshot:

1. Run the application by opening index.html in your browser
2. Configure the application with some images and settings
3. Take a screenshot of the full interface (1280x720 recommended)
4. Save the screenshot as "screenshot1.jpg" in this directory

The manifest.json file is already configured to reference this screenshot, which will be used when users install the application as a PWA.
